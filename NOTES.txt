A file where I dumped ideas for this project.

CLI Commands:
- Add `init` and `install`
  `init` is used initialize the ".mcserver" directory and its configurations.
  And `install` is used to install and setup the Minecraft server with the configuration inside ".mcserver".

Mod Management:
- Add mod search command with Modrinth

Miscellaneous
- Rename "ram" to "memory"?
- Shrink the project scope first
